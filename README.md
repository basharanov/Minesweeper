# Minesweeper
Simple minesweeper


Got some of the code from this tutorial - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfhfAxKFP-s

Things that I added:
- reset button
- 3 difficulties
- timer
- made it that your first click can't be a mine
- can't place flags on tiles that are clicked or revealed
- can't click on a flag and than explode
- when a tile is flaged you cant reveal the tile
- when the game end in a loss it's shows which flags are wrong
